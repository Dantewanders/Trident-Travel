                    If you want to reach Gokyo Lake, Stay in Namche 3-4 days minimum for the best acclimatization, making some tours to Monk (4000), Khumjung (3800), Tengboche. For a beautiful 3 day trek spend 1 night - Dole, second night - Macchermo. There are 6 lakes there. Usually tourists see only first 3 of them, because Gokyo village situated on the shore of 3-d lake. But 4-th, 5-th and 6-th lakes are fantastically beautiful and I strongly recommend you to visit them. * 4-th lake is just 1 hour to go by the path from the Gokyo village up. It's very easy and you can do it yourself without any guide. *5-th lake is 2 hours more up, and I recommend you to take a guide to go there, because it's quite easy to loose way back, especially if fog will come. *6-th lake - is extremely impressive, you will remember it for all your life. It's 2 more hours. The altitude there is only 5300 meters, so if you spend 3-4 days in Gokyo village and have a normal acclimatization, it's not problem. Be VERY attentive with acclimatization. Don't rush to go up if you feel yourself not good - it's really dangerous. I think, that if you want to make a safe trip to Gokyo lakes, you need around 20 days for all the tour from Lukla to Lukla, not less.

Fish originates from the clear waters of the Inari region and the nearby Arctic Ocean. Game is hunted from the local forest, the same one that berries, mushroom and wild herbs are picked from. Whether you are in a fine-dining restaurant or on an outdoor lunch during your ice-fishing trip, you can taste the pure northern flavours in every mouthful. The abundant choice of restaurants in Inari-Saariselkä guarantees that both foodies and pizza lovers find a restaurant to their liking.
