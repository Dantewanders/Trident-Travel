This is my first HTML project for JRS Coding Bootcamp</h3>

<h3 align="left">
We were given the challenge of creating a travel website after a morning of HTML. </h3>
<h3 align="left">
The project is HTML5 basic with some forms and an introduction to CSS3 & JavaScript.</h3>
<h3 align="left">
I created a NavBar with links to three pages, a testimonials page which utilized avatars and custom cards. I added transition colors and simple forms for subscriptions.</h3>
