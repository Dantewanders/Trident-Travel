This is my first HTML project for JRS Coding Bootcamp</h3>

We were given the challenge of creating a travel website after a morning of HTML. This is HTML5 basics with some forms and an introduction to CSS3. I created a NavBar with links to three pages. A testimonials page which utilized avatars and custom cards. Transition colors and simple forms for subscriptions.</h3>
