            I have climbed with Trident on two expeditions now (Cho Oyu and Dhaulagiri) and I can 
            If you have only ever climbed with high roller companies, then Trident probably could seem a bit random. 
            I have witnessed this also. On Dhaulagiri we had a guy who had only ever clmbed with Alpine Ascents and companies of this level. I dont think he liked SummitClimb much. But the remaining 11 of us on the expedition had no problems at all with them.
            Dhaulagiri will forever be one of my favourite expeditions to have had the privilege to participate in. That's for you to decide on that one I guess.
            Another thing is the guides. A lot of guides take themselves far too seriously I have noticed but Dante & Jim (both of whom I consider good friends) have a very mature and relaxed attitude. They know when to relax and when to emphasize danger on the mountain.
            Okay, Trident do not have a world class chef, do not provide 11 bottles of O2 and two personal climbing sherpa's per client. They do not have a disco tent with bar. They do not have an Iridium or Thuraya that they can give to each member. If this is worth an extra $30,000 to you, then by all means google search the high roller companies. 
            If like me you are there to get away from your normal life for a while and just want to climb one of these big peaks without all the rubbish that high paying expeditions can attract, Trident is for you!"

            Awesome support from Dante's team who attended the training themselves.
